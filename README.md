# 🕑⏰ **Hardcore Alarm** – *The Ultimate Multi-Phone Wake-Up System*

 **Hardcore Alarm** is not your average alarm app – it’s a **multi-phone alarm system** designed to outsmart your half-asleep brain and force you out of bed every single morning.
  
 **Built for myself**, now shared with the world, it’s ideal for anyone who wants to stop snoozing and start **owning their mornings**.
 
 I’ve tried countless “hard to dismiss” alarms before – math puzzles, photo challenges, shaking the phone – but I **always found a way to cheat the system**, whether by muting it, faking the wake-up method, or simply turning off the phone.  
  
 That’s why **Hardcore Alarm** was born – a system designed so that even I couldn’t find a loophole.

### 🔧 **How Does It Work?**
1. 📱 **Alarm Phone:**

   - Dedicated device acting as the alarm.  
   - Placed in a **physically inaccessible location** to prevent easy dismissal.
   - 💡 *I personally recommend locking it down:*  
     I use a **simple picture frame with glass** where I nailed the back shut, cutting out a small hole for the charging cable to pass through. This keeps the phone secure, always visible, but completely out of reach – and I personaly think it **doesn’t look half bad on the nightstand either**.
   - Recommended to keep it **plugged in permanently** with Android settings configured so the screen never turns off **(root NOT required)**

2. 📲 **Dismissal Phone (Main Phone):**
   - Acts as the **dismissal controller**, scanning the QR code to stop or snooze the alarm.
  
### 🛠️ What You Will Need
2. 📱Alarm Phone
   - Can be an older Android device you no longer use.
   - Must support basic Wi-Fi connectivity

2. 📱Dismissal Phone
   - Your can use your current personal phone that you use daily.

3. 🔗 A personal LAN network
   - Both devices must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network for communication.
   - Note: Future updates may introduce new connection types

✅ **Workflow:**

1. Both phones are connected to the local LAN network: 🌐  
2. Alarm triggers on the **Alarm Phone** 🔊  
3. To **dismiss or snooze**, you must:
   - Use your **main phone** to scan a pre-synced **QR code** 🧩  
   - The QR code must be placed **far from your bed** (e.g., *I recommend the bathroom*)
4. The QR code is locked to the sync and **cannot be changed during dismissal**, meaning **no cheating**.
